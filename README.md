A To-Do List application is a useful project that helps users manage
and organize their tasks efficiently. This project aims to create a
command-line or GUI-based application using Python, allowing
users to create, update, and track their to-do lists.
<br>
A To-Do list is a list of tasks we require to complete or things we would like to do.
<br>
Most typically, the tasks in this list are arranged in order of priority. By tradition, they are written on a piece of paper or post-it notes and act as a memory aid. Due to the evolution in technology, we have been able to create a To-Do lists with Excel Spreadsheets, Word Documents, E-mail Lists, and To-Do List applications like Microsoft to-do and Google to-do lists. We can utilize a to-do list in our home, workplace, or personal life.
<br>
Having a list of everything we are supposed to do written down in one place implies that we should not forget anything significant. By prioritizing the tasks in the list, we can play the order of doing them and quickly observe what requires our immediate attention and what tasks can be delayed for a while.
