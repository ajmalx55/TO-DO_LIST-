# 📝 To-Do List Application using Tkinter

## 🚀 Overview
This project is a simple To-Do List application built using Tkinter, a standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) toolkit for Python. The application allows users to add tasks, view existing tasks, and delete completed tasks..

## ✨ Features
- **Add Task**: Users can input tasks in the provided text box and click the "Add" button to append them to the list.
- **Delete Task**: Users can select a task from the list and click the "Delete" button to remove it from the list.
- **Persistent Storage**: Tasks are stored in a text file (`data.txt`) to maintain the task list between application sessions.

2. Enter a task in the text box and click the "Add" button to add it to the list.
3. Select a task from the list and click the "Delete" button to remove it.
4. The task list is persisted in the `data.txt` file and will be loaded automatically on subsequent runs of the application.

## 🛠️ Directory Structure
